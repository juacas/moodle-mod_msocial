# Overview

The students need to register themselves in the activity with their social network account to establish the linking between their social identity and the moodle indentity.

The teacher need to register himself in the activity to activate the module and allow the server to connect periodically to the external services on his behalf (with the permissions granted by the teacher).
 
## Configuration

Important: Some connectors need to have a valid, approved, API key provided by the service provider (i.e. Facebook).
Any subplugin can be disabled per-instance.

# Confidentiality

Permissions asked by the connectors allow the server to collect the content posted by the users that meets the criteria set by the teacher. In example, only posts that contains a set of hashtags are retrieved and stored in the course. Every other content are ignored and not stored.

In some social networks the content can come from private groups but others only support publicly readable content. Consult each connector details if you are concerned by those issues.
